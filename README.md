## üìä Key Features  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and standardize features for modeling.  

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Trained and evaluated three models:  
     - **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy = 85.21%  
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Accuracy = 83.27%  
     - **Random Forest Classifier**: Accuracy = 84.82%  
   - Compared performance using a bar graph for visual analysis.  

3. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Built a Plotly Dash-based web app to visualize data insights and model predictions interactively.

## üöÄ Project Highlights  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Addressed missing values and outliers.  
- Normalized data for KNN and Random Forest models.  

### 2. Machine Learning Models  
- Logistic Regression for linear separation.  
- K-Nearest Neighbors for distance-based classification.  
- Random Forest for robust tree-based modeling.  
- Evaluated models using accuracy scores:
